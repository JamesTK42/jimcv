    <h1>Personal Statement</h1>
    <p class="PS">A recent graduate from university, having been awarded a first-class honour classification in Forensic
        Science
        and Criminal Investigation and a Masters of Science in Cybercrime Investigation. I have built my skills in
        photography and cybercrime and have worked consistently through all modules.
        <br><br>
        As some of the photographic equipment I experimented on was new and unused to the university, the findings in my
        dissertation
        have been used for future teaching in this field.
        <br><br>
        To complete my masters degree I decided to keep on the path of photography and cameras. I wrote my
        dissertation
        on the importance, security and vulnerabilities of different metadata standards. I considered this subject
        choice a good one as it was a balance of my interests and key points I'd learned throughout the year, such
        as
        open source intelligence strategies, digital forensics and cryptographic verification to check for
        manipulation
        and duplicates.
        <br><br>
        Over the past decade I have developed skills using the Adobe Creative Suite, most notably in Adobe Photoshop
        and
        Lightroom although during the course of my degrees, I have also been introduced to videography and new
        photography skills such as 360 photography and drone photography as well as other skills in different
        software
        such as Davinci Resolve, Vegas Pro, PTGui, Blender, Unreal, OBS and Sweethome3D.
        <br><br>
        Covid hit during the closing months of my undergraduate degree at which point I had to quickly adjust from
        being
        in classes in person to all my classes being over Microsoft teams. This method of teaching/ learning
        continued
        over onto my masters degree which did complicate things considering there was a substantial amount of work
        in
        some modules which was supposed to be practical and in person. To combat this difficult situation I was
        given
        access to tools such as VMware and EnCase to use at home for testing Linux distributions and digital
        forensic
        images.
        <br><br>
        Since graduating from university, I have completed level 2 and level 3 courses in coding. At level 2 I
        worked
        with a small team to create a text-based game using the coding language Python and worked independently to
        create a website using HTML and CSS that I host on GitHub. I progressed onto the more advanced level 3
        coding
        course which elaborated on my previous experience and added Javascript and combined python and HTML to
        create a
        flask environment as well as a more efficient layout method for websites using jinja.

        <li><b>Volunteering</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>During my 3rd year at university, I volunteered as a teaching assistant in digital forensic photography
                classes, working alongside experienced tutors. I was trusted to do this as I had proven my knowledge and
                with years of experience with cameras and adobe photoshop and therefore was regularly asked to advise
                students and tutors.

                This time spent volunteering greatly assisted me with my dissertation on the comparison of 360
                photography technology, as I was researching and testing methods and equipment and then relayed my
                findings to others and accepted their feedback on my opinions.
